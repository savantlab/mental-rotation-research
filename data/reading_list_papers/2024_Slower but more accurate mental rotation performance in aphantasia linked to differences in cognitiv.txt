However, aphantasia research has brought such use into question. Here, we assessed a large group of individuals who lack visual imagery (aphantasia) on two mental rotation tasks: a three-dimensional block-shape, and a human manikin rotation task. In both tasks, those with aphantasia had slower, but more accurate responses than controls. Both groups demonstrated classic linear increases in response time and error-rate as functions of angular disparity. In the three-dimensional block-shape rotation task, a within-group speed-accuracy trade-off was found in controls, whereas faster individuals in the aphantasia group were also more accurate. Control participants generally favoured using object-based mental rotation strategies, whereas those with aphantasia favoured analytic strategies. These results suggest that visual imagery is not crucial for successful performance in classical mental rotation tasks, as alternative strategies can be effectively utilised in the absence of holistic mental representations.Previous article in issueNext article in issueKeywordsMental rotationVisual imageryAphantasiaStrategy useMental imageryIndividual differencesRecommended articlesData availabilityData from this research is posted on Open Science Framework: https://osf.io/gd94u/?view_only=ab0edd3bddc3418399d605eaa4f5636d.© 2024 The Authors.
